## Welcome to Convolutional Neural Networks for One Dimensional Data

In this course, we will build some convolutional neural networks from scratch and use them to classify electrocardiogram heartbeats as healthy or irregular.

### What will I learn?

By the time you’re done you will know a lot about convolutional neural networks:

- How convolution works
- How to create a convolutional layer for a neural network
- What considerations need to be taken when working with one dimensional ordered data, like the stock market prices, or audio.
- How to modify a convolutional neural network to get good performance


We will also cover some concepts fundamental to neural networks more generally:

- How to use a neural network to perform classification tasks
- How a softmax layer works and how to implement it
- How a batch normalization layer works and how to implement it
- How to create a neural network layer out of any differentiable function you like

### What do I need to know before I take this course?

You will get the most out of this course if you’re familiar with the concepts behind neural networks, and behind convolutional neural networks in particular. The video tutorials in Course 193 can get you up to speed quickly.
