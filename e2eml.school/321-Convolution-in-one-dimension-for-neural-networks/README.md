# How does the course work?

The course is broken up into sections, each of which consists of several lectures or lessons. Most of these are in a video format and require nothing more than watching or reading along. By the time the course is complete, I expect there will be about three hours of material.

You can choose the level of depth at which you engage the material. Here are a few options:

- The Skim. (1 hour) You can skip through the lessons and cherry pick the parts that you are curious about or that catch your eye.

- The Walkthrough. (3 hours) A natural way to engage with material is to step through each of the videos and posts from beginning to end. This will give a complete once over for the entire collection of concepts, code, and explanation.

- The Deep Dive. (10 hours) To take your engagement to the next level, you can stop after each lesson and write down at least three questions. Any variety is helpful - What does that mean? How does that work? Why do we do it that way? What if we tried this instead? How could I use that to solve the problem I'm working on? - Generating questions as you go pulls your mind into a much deeper engagement with the materials. It also sets you off on curiosity-driven tangents, small and not so small, that immeasurably deepen your learning experience.

- The Explore. (up to you) Finally, once you are ready you can use this course as a jumping off point and start making changes to the code yourself. You can try out different architectures, different sequences of layers. You can make different design decisions, try out different hyperparameter combinations. You can extend CNNs to new data sets. Throughout the course we will call out opportunities for making modifications and running experiments of your own. Cottonwood was designed to facilitate experimentation, to let your curiosity run wild. There is no better way to get a down-to-the-roots understanding of how these concepts work.

The concepts here run pretty deep. One strategy is to make several passes through the course at different depths. A Skim, followed by a Walkthrough, and then some quality time in an Explore is a sequence that guarantees you will get the most out of the material.
