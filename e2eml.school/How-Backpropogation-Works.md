Sensitivity is measured using partial differentials

dx/dm = 2
dy/dx = 1/4

E = |y-y'|

So now we have a few different sensitivities, ∂y/∂h, ∂y/∂x, and ∂x/∂m. This is a solid start. This is exactly what we need to start calculating what adjustments we need to make.

One thing that jumps out is that we don’t actually know the sensitivity of the shower flow rate with respect to the main valve. We don’t know ∂y/∂m. However, with a little bit of puzzling we can figure it out. Imagine that we had measured ∂x/∂m to be two. For every unit change in main valve position, the house flow rate increases by two. Also assume that we had measured ∂y/∂x to be 1/4. For every unit change in house flow rate, the showerhead flow rate increases by 1/4 unit. Now, we can play out what would happen to the showerhead flow rate if we increase the main valve position by one unit. ∂x/∂m says the house flow rate would go up by two. And since we know that every unit of house flow rate increases the showerflow rate by 1/4, we can multiply the two together to get the net result. 2×1/4 equals 1/2. A unit change in main valve position gives an increase of showerhead flow rate of half a unit.
