```sql
CREATE TABLE FruitEaten (
  uid integer,
  fruit character varying(20)
);
COPY fruiteaten(uid, fruit) FROM 'fruiteaten.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

In this table, each row represents one fruit eaten. So if person 1 eats two apples, then there will be two rows in the table with column values (1, apple). Consider a simple query counting how many of each fruit have been eaten.

```sql
SELECT fruit, COUNT(fruit)
FROM FruitEaten
GROUP BY fruit;
```

Suppose that instead of getting the regular count, we want the differentially private count with the privacy parameter Îµ=ln(3). The final product of the query rewrite would be

```sql
SELECT result.fruit, result.number_eaten
FROM (
  SELECT per_person.fruit,
    ANON_SUM(per_person.fruit_count, LN(3)/2) as number_eaten,
    ANON_COUNT(uid, LN(3)/2) as number_eaters
    FROM(
      SELECT * , ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY uid
        ORDER BY random()
      ) as row_num
      FROM (
        SELECT fruit, uid, COUNT(fruit) as fruit_count
        FROM FruitEaten
        GROUP BY fruit, uid
      ) as per_person_raw
    ) as per_person
  WHERE per_person.row_num <= 5
  GROUP BY per_person.fruit
) as result
WHERE result.number_eaters > 50;
```

As we can see, there are four SELECTS in the query. We will explain them from inner-most to outer-most. The following steps were taken to rewrite the query:

* Construct the 1st and inner-most `SELECT`, aliased as `per_person_raw`.

```sql
SELECT fruit, uid, COUNT(fruit) as fruit_count
FROM FruitEaten
GROUP BY fruit, uid;
```

For each person, count how many of each fruit that person ate.

Construct the 2nd `SELECT`, aliased as `per_person`.

```sql
SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
  PARTITION BY uid
  ORDER BY random()
) as row_num
FROM per_person_raw;
```

For each person, `per_person_raw` contains rows corresponding to the fruits they have eaten. We shuffle these rows and assign them a row number. This will allow us to effectively [reservoir sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling) rows for each user by filtering by row number in the next step. This is similar to C_u thresholding in Wilson et al.


Construct the 3rd `SELECT`, aliased as result.

```sql
SELECT per_person.fruit,
       ANON_SUM(per_person.fruit_count, LN(3)/2) as number_eaten,
       ANON_COUNT(uid, LN(3)/2) as number_eaters
FROM per_person
WHERE per_person.row_num <= 5
GROUP BY per_person.fruit;
```

First, for each person, we ensure that the person only contributed to 5 fruit groups by filtering on the **randomized row number** generated in the previous step. Then, for each fruit, we sum the number of the fruit that each person ate. We also count the number of people who ate that fruit. This will allow us to ensure we only release the sums which enough people contributed to.
