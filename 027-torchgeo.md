# Why TorchGeo? What problem does it solve?


- What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is a library for training deep learning models.

- What is TorchGeo?

TorchGeo is a library for simplifying the application of deep learning methodology to remotely sensed data.

- What is Remotely sensed geospatial data?

Remotely sensed data refers to data collected about the planet earth, but isn't limited to Earth. It could be other planets, moons, asteroids and even stars. On Earth the data is colleted using sensors that are deployed to platforms. These platforms and sensors both vary a great deal. For example remote sensing data may come from platfroms in space (using satellites) or within the earth's atmosphere (using aircraft or drones) and in the ocean (on the hulls of ships or submersible). As you can see from the above statement these platforms alone range hugely in varity. So do the sensors and thus the data. Sensors can range from those designed to collect data about the atmopsheric gasses to underwater trenchs. There is an incredible variety of data that comes from remote sensing.
