# Path to production mapping

Although path-to-production mapping has been a near-universal practice at Thoughtworks since
codifying Continuous Delivery, we often come across organizations unfamiliar with the practice. The
activity is most often done in a workshop with a cross-functional group of people — that includes
everyone involved in designing, developing, releasing and operating the software — around a shared
whiteboard (or virtual equivalent). First, the steps in the process are listed in order, from the developer
workstation all the way to production. Then, a facilitated session is used to capture further information
and pain points. The most common technique we see is based on value-stream mapping, although
plenty of process map variants are equally valuable. The activity is often eye-opening for many of
the participants, as they identify delays, risks and inconsistencies and continue to use the visual
representation for the continuous improvement of the build and deploy process. We consider this
technique so foundational that we were surprised to discover we hadn’t blipped it before.

# Team Cognitive Load

Team interaction is a key concept when redesigning an organization for business agility and speed. These interactions will be reflected in the software being built (see Conway's Law) and indicate how effectively teams can autonomously deliver value to their customers. Our advice is to be intentional about how teams are designed and how they interact. Because we believe that organizational design and team interactions evolve over time, we think it's particularly important to measure and keep track of the team cognitive load, which indicates how easy or difficult teams find building, testing and maintaining their services. We've been using a template to assess team cognitive load that is based on ideas by the authors of the Team Topologies book.
