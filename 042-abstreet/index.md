# A/B Street

## What is A/B Street?

A software for simulating transport planning. It works anywhere there is OSM data. It allows editing of data within the software to test different scenarios. The world of transport network encoding uses its own standards. I am just starting to learn about this. One of these standards is called GMNS. GMNS stands for General Modeling Network Specification. Another standard is [Transportation Analysis Modeling and Simulation](https://highways.dot.gov/research/operations/analysis-modeling-simulation/analysis-modeling-simulation-overview) (AMS) Data Hub. This is a project that is working to standardize transport data. 

The GMNS format is a unifying data format for AMS. [Here](https://github.com/stars/sabman/lists/transport-planning) are some relevant GH projects in this domain.
