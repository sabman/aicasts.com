# A/B Street

## What is A/B Street?

A software for simulating transport planning. It works anywhere there is OSM data. It allows editing of data within the software to test different scenarios. The world of transport network encoding uses its own standards. I am just starting to learn about this. One of these standards is called GMNS. GMNS stands for General Modeling Network Specification. Another standard is [Transportation Analysis Modeling and Simulation](https://highways.dot.gov/research/operations/analysis-modeling-simulation/analysis-modeling-simulation-overview) (AMS) Data Hub. This is a project that is working to standardize transport data. [This is a video](https://vimeo.com/808695375/ad9a1fc754) introducing the project.


The GMNS format is a unifying data format for AMS. [Here](https://github.com/stars/sabman/lists/transport-planning) are some relevant GH projects in this domain.

## What problems does A/B Street solve?

A/B Street is a traffic simulation game exploring how small changes to roads affect cyclists, transit users, pedestrians, and drivers. In other words, you can transform that street parking into a bus lane or fix that pesky left turn at a traffic signal, measure the effects, then propose actually making the change.

A/B Street uses game-like elements to gradually introduce all of the features of the simulation, with a tutorial and a few challenge modes. But just becaused it's called a "game" doesn't mean it's not trying to model the real world as accurately as possible from open data. (Keep in mind it's impossible to simulate all complexity in the real world of people moving around a city. Every traffic model makes lots of assumptions and trade-offs, including A/B Street.)
