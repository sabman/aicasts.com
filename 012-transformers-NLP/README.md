Computers don‚Äôt process information in the same way as humans. For example, when we read the sentence ‚ÄúI am hungry,‚Äù we can easily understand its meaning. Similarly, given two sentences such as ‚ÄúI am hungry‚Äù and ‚ÄúI am sad,‚Äù we‚Äôre able to easily determine how similar they are. For machine learning (ML) models, such tasks are more difficult. The text needs to be processed in a way that enables the model to learn from it. And because language is complex, we need to think carefully about how this processing must be done. There has been a lot of research done on how to represent text, and we will look at some methods in the next chapter.

In this section, we will look at what Transformer models can do and use our first tool from the ü§ó Transformers library: the pipeline() function.

Transformers are everywhere!
Transformer models are used to solve all kinds of NLP tasks, like the ones mentioned in the previous section. Here are some of the companies and organizations using Hugging Face and Transformer models, who also contribute back to the community by sharing their models:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
classifier("I've been waiting for a HuggingFace course my whole life.")

classifier(
    ["I've been waiting for a HuggingFace course my whole life.", "I hate this so much!"]
)
```

By default, this pipeline selects a particular pretrained model that has been fine-tuned for sentiment analysis in English. The model is downloaded and cached when you create the classifier object. If you rerun the command, the cached model will be used instead and there is no need to download the model again.

There are three main steps involved when you pass some text to a pipeline:

1. The text is preprocessed into a format the model can understand.
2. The preprocessed inputs are passed to the model.
3. The predictions of the model are post-processed, so you can make sense of them.
   Some of the currently available pipelines are:

- feature-extraction (get the vector representation of a text)
- fill-mask
- ner (named entity recognition)
- question-answering
- sentiment-analysis
- summarization
- text-generation
- translation
- zero-shot-classification

Let‚Äôs have a look at a few of these!

### Zero-shot classification

We‚Äôll start by tackling a more challenging task where we need to classify texts that haven‚Äôt been labelled. This is a common scenario in real-world projects because annotating text is usually time-consuming and requires domain expertise. For this use case, the zero-shot-classification pipeline is very powerful: it allows you to specify which labels to use for the classification, so you don‚Äôt have to rely on the labels of the pretrained model. You‚Äôve already seen how the model can classify a sentence as positive or negative using those two labels ‚Äî but it can also classify the text using any other set of labels you like.

```py
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification")
classifier(
    "This is a course about the Transformers library",
    candidate_labels=["education", "politics", "business"],
)
```


## Text generation

Now let‚Äôs see how to use a pipeline to generate some text. The main idea here is that you provide a prompt and the model will auto-complete it by generating the remaining text. This is similar to the predictive text feature that is found on many phones. Text generation involves randomness, so it‚Äôs normal if you don‚Äôt get the same results as shown below.


```py
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline("text-generation")
generator("In this course, we will teach you how to")
```
## Using any model from the Hub in a pipeline

The previous examples used the default model for the task at hand, but you can also choose a particular model from the Hub to use in a pipeline for a specific task ‚Äî say, text generation. Go to the Model Hub and click on the corresponding tag on the left to display only the supported models for that task. You should get to a page like this one.

Let‚Äôs try the distilgpt2 model! Here‚Äôs how to load it in the same pipeline as before:
