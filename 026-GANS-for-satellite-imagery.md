### Intro to GANs

GANs are composed of two deep neural networks. The first network is called the generator, and itâ€™s basically responsible for creating new instances of data from random noise. The second network is called discriminator, and it "judges" if the data generated by the generator is real or fake by comparing it to real data.

### build a generator and discriminator

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # plotting to see how our synthetic data compares to real data
import pandas as pd # data frames for easier manipulation of data
import seaborn as sns # create heatmaps to visualize data
import torch # PyTorch
import torch.nn.functional as F # useful functions in PyTorch

from layers import MultiCategoryGumbelSoftmax # internal class for multicategory outputs
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder # convert our data into a format PyTorch can understand
```
