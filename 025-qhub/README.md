Components
The technology stack is an integration of the following existing open source libraries:

Terraform a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure.

Kubernetes a cloud-agnostic orchestration system

Helm: a package manager for Kubernetes

JupyterHub: a shareable compute platform for data science

JupyterLab: a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter Notebooks

Dask: a scalable and flexible library for parallel computing in Python

Dask-Gateway: a secure, multi-tenant server for managing Dask clusters

traefik for routing web/tcp traffic inside cluster

traefik-forward-auth single sign on and easy securing of web applications

GitHub Actions: a tool to automate, customize, and execute software development workflows in a GitHub repository.

Amongst the newly created open source libraries on the tech stack are:

jupyterhub-ssh brings the SSH experience to a modern cluster manager.

jupyter-videochat allows video-chat with JupyterHub peers inside JupyterLab, powered by Jitsi.

conda-store serves identical conda environments and controls its life-cycle.

conda-docker, an extension to the docker concept of having declarative environments that are associated with Docker images allowing tricks and behaviour that otherwise would not be allowed.
