In this challenge, given two pieces of texts, we have to determine if they were written by the same author or two different authors based on the writing "style".

To test the quality of the model there are three distinct verification tasks, each task is to be released every year starting in 2020 and ending 2022.

Year 1 (PAN 2020): Closed-set verification.
